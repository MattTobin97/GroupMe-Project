# GroupMe-Project
## Matt Tobin
#### Project Goals:  Answer these questions: How many messages have I sent in a group? When was a group created?
##### I chose this project out of personal interest in wondering how many messages my friends and I had sent since we created our group message.  The API was presented to me by a friend at another school. 
###### Resources:

Future development ideas would include implementing OAuth 2.0 so that any user can make use of these functions and figure out how much they have used GroupMe.
